# RAP_Champions_survey_analysis
Code for the RAP champions in DfE to use to perform analysis on the RAP survey results.

## Important Access Info

The first thing you need to do is sync your file explorer with the RAP Champions sharepoint folder. This is where the survey data is stored and there is a function in this project that uses your dfe username to access it.

1. Open the RAP Champions Teams Area

2. Click on Files

3. Click on Sync

4. Check that this has synced. To do this, open your file explorer and look in the sidebar for Department for Education. Click on this and you will hopefully see a folder called `DfE RAP champions - General`. If not, or if you encounter an error, talk to Seth Price and we'll try to sort it out.
