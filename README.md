# RAP_Champions_survey_analysis
Code for the RAP champions in DfE to use to perform analysis on the RAP survey results.

## Important Access Info

The first thing you need to do is sync your file explorer with the RAP Champions sharepoint folder. This is where the survey data is stored and there is a function in this project that uses your dfe username to access it.

1. Open the RAP Champions Teams Area

2. Click on Files

3. Click on Sync

4. Check that this has synced. To do this, open your file explorer and look in the sidebar for Department for Education. Click on this and you will hopefully see a folder called `DfE RAP champions - General`. If not, or if you encounter an error, talk to Seth Price and we'll try to sort it out.

## Cloning this code

To clone this project:

1. Click the green <> Code button above

2. Copy the HTTPS url when prompted

3. Start a new R project and select Version Control > Git > [paste in url]

This project currently only contains basic analysis so you'll need to add your own after you've cloned it. If you'd like to contribute to this project collaboratively, speak to Charlotte Foster and she will give you push permission. You won't be able to push until you do this!

## Using the code

The main script you will need to use and adapt is `analyse_survey.R`. You can change and add to this file as much as you like, but if you want to push your project ever consider leaving it as it is and creating your own file to analyse your division.
